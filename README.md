- It can be run locally or using Docker
- It can be deployed to Huggingface space via Docker Space SDK

## Pre-requisites
- OpenAI API Key
- Docker (if using this option)
- Huggingface account (if deploy to Huggingface Space)


## Running Locally
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LIFENGZI1015/streamlit-llmapp.git
```
2. Install dependencis
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"
```
